# GitHub Management Steward

`github-mgmt stewards` is a team of people who are responsible for managing the GitHub Management configuration for the organization. They have write access to the GitHub Management repository, can review change requests and merge changes to the `master` branch.

Membership in the `github-mgmt stewards` team should be treated with **exactly as much care as having admin access to the organization**.
