          # GitHub Management via Terraform: pl-strflt


          This repository is responsible for managing GitHub configuration of `pl-strflt` organisation as code with Terraform. It was created from [github-mgmt-template](https://github.com/protocol/github-mgmt-template) and it will receive updates from that repository.


          **IMPORTANT**: Having write access to GitHub Management repository can be as powerful as having admin access to the organizations managed by that repository.


          *NOTE*: Because we don't have merge queue functionality enabled for the repository yet, after a merge, wait for the `Apply` and `Update` workflows to complete before merging any other PRs.
